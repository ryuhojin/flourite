// title: Why I use Linux instead of other OS
// date: 2020-02-27
// desc: A post where I try to explain why I use this beautiful and awesome operating system called Linux
// tags:
//   - linux
// ---

// # Table of Content

// # Introduction
// Hello internet people of the internet! In this post, I will explain the reason why I use Linux and how I know Linux. Well, the correct term here should be GNU/Linux but it's _way_ too long let's be honest. So, whenever I say Linux, what I mean is GNU/Linux. Let's start with how I know Linux.

// # Origin
// ## My first laptop
// It all started when I want to buy my first laptop. Roughly about 9 months ago. It runs Intel Celeron N4000 processor, which is pretty bad (yeah, I know). At that time, I didn't know about Thinkpad which most of people said has the best value for its price. So, I do some quick research on how ~~slow~~ fast this processor runs. It turns out, it's pretty bad.

// ## How I know Linux
// I heard a lot of people say that Windows 10 is heavy for a slow processor like mine. It's bloat, it's too heavy, too many things going on, there's some malicious virus that can easily infect your computer, yaddi yadda. To be honest, I became a bit sad at that time. Then I came across a post on Facebook saying something like "Try Linux if your laptop/pc isn't powerful enough to run windows." Then I start to wonder, what is this guy talking about? Linux? I never heard that before.

// I became interested in that. Bare in mind that I don't have any laptop yet. I don't know why I love to read some articles about Linux and joined on several groups even if I don't have any machine that runs Linux (I even help people solve issues that they have on their Linux machine even though I don't have any laptop. That's quite something if you ask me). It's an interesting operating system (mainly because I never heard of it). Somehow, I like the fact that most people don't use it. I like to be different. Finally, after about a month, I bought my very first laptop.

// ## My first distribution
// Linux has so many distributions. Like, a gazillion of them. But from what I observe, there are only a few "big boys" that stands out from the others. Some of them are Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro, OpenSUSE, Fedora, RHEL, PopOS, etc. I got confused easily on which one is the best for me. Then I decided to check what's that guy is using on Facebook.

// The guy on Facebook runs [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.org). I was like, "Why did he choose that? That's a silly name for Linux." Not gonna lie, that's my first impression lol. About a week later, I tried to install one of Linux distribution after getting convinced enough. The one that I chose was [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com). At that time, I installed Linux Mint 19.1 XFCE Edition. I was so happy to be able to install Linux. Unfortunately, I lost my first screenshot on Linux Mint.

// ## Changing distribution
// A month has passed. I feel pretty comfortable with Linux. Then, there was this news saying that Ubuntu dropped their support for 32bit libraries. Do you remember that news? I was like, "Well, that's fine I guess. What's wrong with that?" Little did I know, 32bit libraries are what most games depend on. Then I started to panic and confused lmao.

// I was like, "Oh come on. I'm already comfortable with my current setup. I still want to play some games but I don't want to change my distribution." Yep, that's literally what I said. And you know what? f*** it. Imma change my distribution. I decided to choose Manjaro since it's not based on Ubuntu. Yep, the one that I've mentioned before. A distribution that I thought has a stupid name (I felt so guilty now lol). Then I started to think, "Who cares about names anyway. As long as it is usable, it's good."

// Finally, I installed it. I took a quick screenshot after installing it because I was so excited. Here, take a look!

// ![manjaro](/assets/post/why-i-use-linux/manjaro.png)

// Manjaro is based on Arch. Some people say that it's Arch without all of its fuss. I mean, it's true. At the time I'm writing this, I use Arch. For beginners that want to try Archlinux, it's a good starting point. I ended up using it for nearly 8 months. It was a great experience.

// # Why Linux?
// So, why do I use Linux then? Well, let me give you a quick list of why Linux is better than the other OS
//   - **It's free**

//       Linux is free both in price and free as in freedom. You don't have to pay for license and you can do anyting you want with it. You can customize your Desktop Environment (look and feel) or even build your very own kernel!

//   - **It's lightweight**

//       Linux is so lightweight. It can bring your old hardware to life. There's this joke that says "Linux can run on everything". Starting from [business card](https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/) (yes, there's someone out there who built their business card with Linux inside it) until your high end $50000 beast or whatever.

//   - **It's secure**

//       Linux is very secure. That's why most of servers around the world is using Linux for it. You don't have to worry to install antivirus to prevent ransomware getting into your system. No need to worry on that stuff.

//   - **There's always something to learn**

//       Like, seriously. You can always learn something new everyday. There are so much good stuff that you can learn from Linux. If you like something challenging, go ahead and try Linux.

//   - **Package Manager**

//       Now this is the stuff that makes me really love Linux. Linux has a centralized place to download any app that you want. You don't need to go to some kind of obscure website and find the correct download link. You just need to \`apt install\` or \`pacman - S\` any package that you want and it's totally secure.

// # Conclusion
// At first, I'm afraid that I can't install Windows on my new laptop. Who would've thought that in the end, I use Archlinux which some people say that it's difficult to install. I think it's not that hard, follow the wiki and you're set (said someone who had failed to install Archlinux 3 times lmao).

// Alright, this post will end right here. I might post why I use VIM/Window Managers next time. See ya in the next post everyone, have a good day!`);

  How I created my new website with portfolio and blog in two languages. What technology I used and why.
---

## Why did I re-do my website with Nuxt?

Although some of you already know me, I am [Marina Aísa](https://twitter.com/MarinaAisa), UX Engineer (design and front-end) and I currently work at [Holaluz](https://www.holaluz.com/en).

Last year, 2018, I was very focused on learning more about JavaScript, which was a pending subject and at the same time I learnt [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Meanwhile at my workplace, we started using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) a framework on VueJS to remake both company's static and dynamic (SPA) webapps into components and create a design system with it.

My previous website was made with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) a static pages generator based on Ruby, so I took the opportunity to redo my website with Nuxt and Vue, in order to:
- To learn
- Improve performance
- Add functionality as a blog and portfolio system
- Add two languages, Spanish and English, **also in blog posts** but independently, since I guess I won't translate every post in both languages.

What attracts me the most of Nuxt is the philosophy *serverless* (Nuxt can also be SSR tho) and the static prerendering it provides to SPA applications. Briefly, with this stack you can combine the best of a static website: compiled HTML -> what leads to a better SEO, plus the best of a *single page application*: Webpack, cache optimizations, lazy-loading, functions and asynchronous data...

## But where do I get the content if I don't have a server?

Nuxt, by following the architecture [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) is built to get content through APIs, so many people use headless CMSs like [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) or [Prismic](https://prismic.io/). At first I thought they were interesting options but I realized that it wasn't necessary for a website like mine since CMSs are oriented to be used by people without technical knowledge, besides they are expensive, they save assets on their own servers and they aren't the best option if I wanted to have the best performance.

**Therefore, I decided to use a Markdowns system that I store in Github and call dynamically.**

### Importing posts on the main page depending on the language

Using the asynchronous function \`asyncData\` that Nuxt provides only in its pages (it is not avalaible in its components) I import the Markdowns that I have saved in the folder \`content\` of the project. Later I return them in the form of a promise as an array of objects. As you can see below, this import depends on the constant \`blogs\` which will be the array \`blogsEs\` or \`blogsEn\` depending on the language of the page stored on the Vuex's state.

\`\`\`javascript
import blogsEn from '~/contents/en/blogsEn.js';
import blogsEs from '~/contents/es/blogsEs.js'

async asyncData({ app }) {
  const blogs = app.i18n.locale === 'en' ? blogsEn : blogsEs;

  async function asyncImport(blogName) {
    const wholeMD = await import(\`~/content/\${app.i18n.locale}/blog/\${blogName}.md\`);
    return wholeMD.attributes;
  }

  return Promise.all(blogs.map(blog => asyncImport(blog)))
    .then((res) => {
      return {
        blogs: res
      };
    });
}
\`\`\`

The reason why I'm importing the arrays containing the blogs names is because I want to use it also to generate the static pages through the object [generate](https://nuxtjs.org/api/configuration-generate/) in the Nuxt configuration, file \`nuxt.config.js\`.

\`\`\`javascript;
import blogsEn from '~/contents/en/blogsEn.js';
import blogsEs from '~/contents/es/blogsEs.js';

generate: {
  routes: [
    '/es', '404'
  ]
    .concat(blogsEn.map(blog => \`/blog/\${blog}\`))
    .concat(blogsEs.map(blog => \`es/blog/\${blog}\`));
}
\`\`\`

### Generating dynamic pages from Markdown files

Nuxt has a very interesting functionality, the creation of [dynamic routes](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing/#dynamic-routes).

In the next import I use the function \`asyncData\` instead of \`data\` as it's usual in Vue, to first import each Markdown and then return a new object with the information I want to use in the template of the page.
**The URL will be equal to each markdown file's name.**
In the case that the md file doesn't exist it will simply go to error page 404.

\`\`\`javascript
async asyncData({ params, app }) {
  const fileContent = await import(\`~/contents/\${app.i18n.locale}/blog/\${params.slug}.md\`);
  const attr = fileContent.attributes;
  return {
    colors: attr.colors,
    date: attr.date,
    description: attr.description,
    id: attr.id,
    name: params.slug,
    related: attr.related,
    renderFunc: fileContent.vue.render,
    staticRenderFuncs: fileContent.vue.staticRenderFns,
    title: attr.title,
    urlTranslation: attr.urlTranslation
  };
}
\`\`\`

If we wanted to create a portfolio in the future, it would be exactly the same as the blog. We would create within \`contents\` a folder called \`portfolio\` and we would do the same process that we have done with \`blogs\`.

The loader for Webpack Markdown files that I use is: [frontmatter-markdown-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/frontmatter-markdown-loader) that allows me to put Vue components inside markdown files, as well as extract the \`frontmatter\` attributes as they do static generators like Jekyll. For making the code look pretty I apply: [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/)

## Let's talk about performance

Do you remember that before I told you that one of my motivations for creating this website was to have a blog that had a good performance?
With Nuxt I have achieved it, and I still have a lot to optimize.

If you have arrived here, you have probably thought: *"OMG Marina, you could just have made a blog in [Medium](https://medium.com/) and save you all this crazy work"* and right now you're going to understand why I don't like Medium.

While writing in Medium **you don't have control over your blog** such as CSS, SEO, adding functionalities, **Medium owns your content**, you have a limit of articles read for free... and **their performance seems quite bad**

Thanks to Google's tool [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/audit/) we can analyze and compare Medium with my website.

<image-responsive
    imageURL="blog/vue-nuxt-blog/performance.jpg"
    :width="'952'"
    :height="'509'"
    alt="performance" />

As you can see, Medium does a lot of things well, but performance is not one of them. This translates into user experience as a very slow load, especially on mobile devices. **Because performance is user experience.** We'll talk more about it another day.
The interesting thing here is that with Nuxt I managed to reach a **94%** performance compared to 40% offered by Medium in the first load, but the best thing is that since using cache systems, **the second load on my website the performance is 100%** while Medium scores 60%.

## Web in two languages

To translate the web in English and Spanish I use [nuxt-i18n](https://github.com/nuxt-community/nuxt-i18n). It is a layer above [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) which has lazy-loading translations. *Nuxt-i18n* automates how translations are worked on the Vue router, simplifying it for Nuxt. I recommend it for the router, although it has some things that I couldn't managed to make it work as the redirection cookie based on the browser language. But it's a problem that you have to accept if you use a new framework like Nuxt is.

## Features and improvements I want to add in the future

- I am not very happy with the amount of JS that I am putting into the web, I have more than 100k of synchronous JS and I want to reduce it. I still have to figure out how. My relationship with JS is love/hate. On the one hand I love everything you can do with it and on the other I hate it because it has a terrible cost on the performance of the page.

- Adding a portfolio system with dynamic pages like the blog.

- Improvements in design and usability.

- Making the web totally accessible from the design to the code.

- Cleaning CSS that I don't use and try to reduce it.

- I criticize a lot Medium but I really like its design and some of its features, in fact I would like to add its famous *clap* button to my website.

- Add comments to each post.

- Add similar posts to the one you've read.

## Things about the webapp that I'll write another day

- Lazy loading of components and images in Nuxt, I will tell you which packages I use and the component I did to render a first image as a *placeholder* in base64 and afterwards asynchronously the final image.

- How to use \`analyze\` of Nuxt to analyze the JS generated by Webpack in our app and to optimize it.

- The big mistake I made along the way: Vuex. <nuxt-link to="/blog/vuex-what-is-when-use-it">You can read it here</nuxt-link>

- How to put emojis on your website through a sprite made in SCSS so that they always look the same regardless of the browser or device.

- Loading Vue asynchronous components with the practical example of the travel map that is in the home page.

I thought about publishing a starter about it but being realist, I wouldn't have enough time to maintain it. I think this post explains how to do it very well, but if you have any doubt left, you can always contact me at my email: [marina@marinaaisa](mailto:marina@marinaaisa.com).

Since I don't have a comments section on each post, I would love to continue the conversation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarinaAisa). All feedback is welcome! If you think there is something that it can be improved, you would help me a lot.`);
